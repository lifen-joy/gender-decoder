                <h2>About this tool</h2>
                <p>This tool was inspired by a research paper written by Danielle Gaucher, Justin Friesen, and Aaron C. Kay back in 2011, called <a href="/static/documents/Gaucher-Friesen-Kay-JPSP-Gendered-Wording-in-Job-ads.pdf">Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality</a> (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, July 2011, Vol 101(1), p109-28).</p> 
                <p>In this paper the researchers showed job adverts which included different kinds of gender-coded language to men and women and recorded how appealing the jobs seemed and how much the participants felt that they 'belonged' in that occupation. No non-binary people were included in this research, and the research didn't touch on non-binary-coded words.</p>
                <p>Their results showed that women felt that job adverts with masculine-coded language were less appealing and that they belonged less in those occupations. For men, feminine-coded adverts were only slightly less appealing and there was no effect on how much the men felt they belonged in those roles.</p>
                <p>To the right are the full lists of words that this research considered masculine- and feminine-coded. This tool checks job adverts for the appearance of any of these words, then calculates the relative proportion of masculine-coded and feminine-coded words to reach an overall verdict on the gender-coding of the advert. Some words have been reduced to a 'stem' to cover a range of noun, verb and adjective variants; for instance "compet" covers "compete", "competetive" and "competition".</p>
